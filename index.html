                <h1>Eggsplotion</h1>
                <p>
                    This project was with seven people for 8 weeks and was the biggest game I have worked on so far. For this project, I coded the gameplay mechanics and the animations. As for the design, I came up with the overall idea and worked on the game mechanics as well as the overall game design.

                <p>
                    In these past months we developed a deepfake generator where you can generate videos in which world leaders say whatever you tell them to say. How to do it? It’s easy! Simply choose your leader, type in what you want them to say and then just wait to see the magic happen.<br><br>
                    My contributions: I did the front-end coding and all of the the design for the application.

                    This project was done over a span of 2 weeks with only four people. This project was our first experience creating a potential business opportunity. We ended up winning the competition with our idea to help children learn in an easier and more visual way.

                <p>
                    Infecto is a single player game, which was a group project done over 8 days with 6 people in the group. The game was made on the GXP engine with our own physics engine. The game’s intention is targeted at children and its purpose is to teach children in a fun way how basic human biology works. The game is a 2D puzzle game where the player needs to figure out a basic puzzle in order to advance.
                    <br><br>My contributions: I worked on the website for the game and did part of the coding for the video game. While also managing the different roles by being the team leader.
